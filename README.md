then toldwhich SpongeBob character they are most like. The program gives a 
breiefdescription of that character and the percentage of how much they are 
like said character. 

There are four source files for this project. These include: Input, Output, Array, and Characters. 

The purpose of the Input class is to ask the user for their name, tell them briefly about the quiz, ask them all the questions for the quiz, and then calculate the percentage of how much the user is like each character based on their reponses. 

The purpose of the Output is to inform the user about their results of which character they most resemble and what percentage they are of that character  
based on their responses to each question. This gives the user a better idea of how alike they are to the character that they were matched to.
